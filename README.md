This is an interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players compete against a computer opponent. The game features animated emoji collisions, a winner emoji that appears at the center of the screen, live score updates, and playful taunts after each round. The interface is fully responsive, with styled buttons, a scoreboard, and smooth animations that make the gameplay visually engaging and fun.

I created this project to practice DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and JavaScript game logic while building a complete browser-based game. One of the main challenges was synchronizing the collision animations with the winner emoji display, ensuring the emoji remained perfectly centered while fading in and out. I also worked through challenges like animating the emojis smoothly without layout shifts, managing multiple timers for the showdown overlay, and dynamically updating the DOM for scores and taunts. Through this project, I learned how to coordinate JS and CSS animations, handle precise element positioning, and improve the overall user experience in an interactive web application.
